Here are some notebooks demonstrating basic tasks implemented with libmolgrid.
We demonstrate usage with PyTorch and Keras with the Tensorflow backend, 
and show how to implement and train a few types of models. For examples of
usage with Caffe, we recommend you look at the <a href="https://github.com/gnina/scripts">gnina scripts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gnina/models">gnina models</a> repositories.
