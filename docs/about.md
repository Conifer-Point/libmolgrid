# About

> libmolgrid is free and open source software created and maintained by [Dr. David Koes](http://bits.csb.pitt.edu) and his research group.

It's part of a larger project, [gnina](https://github.com/gnina/gnina), that aims to leverage machine learning, especially convolutional neural networks, for drug discovery - but it does conventional molecular docking, too.
